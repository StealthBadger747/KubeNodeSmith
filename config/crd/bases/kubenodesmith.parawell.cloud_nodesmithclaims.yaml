                  Each condition has a unique type and reflects the status of a specific aspect of the resource.

                  Condition types for NodeSmithClaim lifecycle:
                  - "Launched": the machine has been created by the provider
                  - "Registered": the node has registered with the cluster
                  - "Initialized": the node is fully initialized and ready
                  - "Ready": overall readiness (depends on other conditions)

                  The status of each condition is one of True, False, or Unknown.
